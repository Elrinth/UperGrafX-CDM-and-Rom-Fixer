# UperGrafX-CDM-and-Rom-Fixer
* Allows you to fix your library of .pce-files and .ccd-cdimages to work with the UperGrafX.

* The program will notify you that the UperGrafX won't work with .pce-files larger than 512KiB.

* To read the actual finished .cdm images with the UperGrafX you need either a System Card 3 .pce file or an actual physical SystemCard 3 or Arcade Card.
