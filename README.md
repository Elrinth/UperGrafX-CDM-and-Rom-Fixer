# UperGrafX-Companion

UperGrafX is a HDMI solution with cd image and .pce rom loading for the Pc-Engine. You can find more information about the unit at the webpage here: http://www.upergrafx.com/home_en



Functions / Features of this program:

* Allows you to fix your library of .pce-files to work with the UperGrafX.

* The program will notify you that the UperGrafX won't work with .pce-files larger than 512KiB (ram restrictions in the hardware design).

* Allows you to convert .ccd-cdimages to .cdm-cdimages which work with UperGrafX.

* If you have daemon tools installed, this program can now convert .bin/.cue cd images to .cdm/.cue - This is a long progress and uses a modified version of the external program CD Manipulator.

* To read the actual finished .cdm images with the UperGrafX you need either a System Card 3 .pce file or an actual physical SystemCard 3 or Arcade Card inserted into your console.

* Obviously this won't fix 100% of the pce files as some, for example public domain files, like the Zelda port won't work. I'm not sure why, but graphics would just appear corrupt for me. Maybe someone else has a clue? My guess is that this program removed 512 bytes of necessary data instead of header data :)
