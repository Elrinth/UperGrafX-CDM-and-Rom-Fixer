# UperGrafX-CDM-and-Rom-Fixer

UperGrafX is a HDMI solution with cd image and .pce rom loading for the Pc-Engine. You can find more information about the unit at the webpage here: http://www.upergrafx.com/home_en



Functions / Features of this program:

* Allows you to fix your library of .pce-files and .ccd-cdimages to work with the UperGrafX.

* The program will notify you that the UperGrafX won't work with .pce-files larger than 512KiB.

* To read the actual finished .cdm images with the UperGrafX you need either a System Card 3 .pce file or an actual physical SystemCard 3 or Arcade Card.

* Obviously this won't fix 100% of the pce files as some, for example public domain files, like the Zelda port won't work. I'm not sure why, but graphics would just appear corrupt for me. Maybe someone else has a clue?
